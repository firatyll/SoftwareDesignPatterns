### Introduction
The Builder Pattern is a creational design pattern used in object-oriented programming to construct complex objects step by step. It separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.

### Purpose
The main purpose of the Builder Pattern is to solve the problem of creating complex objects with multiple parameters. Instead of passing a long list of parameters to a constructor or a static factory method, the Builder Pattern uses a builder object to accumulate the required parameters and construct the object at once.

### How It Works
1. **Create a Builder**: Define a static nested class (or an interface) within the class that you want to build. This builder class will have methods for setting each parameter of the complex object.
   
2. **Set Parameters**: Implement methods in the builder class to set the required parameters of the object being built. Each method should return the builder itself to allow method chaining.

3. **Build the Object**: Create a method in the builder class to construct the complex object based on the provided parameters. This method returns the fully constructed object.

### Benefits
- **Flexible**: Allows constructing objects step by step, varying the representation of the object.
- **Readable**: Improves code readability by providing descriptive method names for setting parameters.
- **Maintainable**: Simplifies adding new parameters or modifying the construction process without changing the client code.
