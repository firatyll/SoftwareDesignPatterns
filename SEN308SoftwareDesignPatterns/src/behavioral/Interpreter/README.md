# Java Interpreter Design Pattern

## Overview

The Interpreter Design Pattern falls under the category of Behavioral Design Patterns. It is used to define a grammatical representation for a language and provides an interpreter to interpret sentences in that language. In simpler terms, it allows you to evaluate sentences in a language that you define.

## Usage

The pattern involves creating an abstract syntax tree, which represents the grammar of the language and then providing an interpreter that can evaluate this grammar.

## Components

1. **AbstractExpression**: Declares an abstract interpret operation that is common to all nodes in the abstract syntax tree.

2. **TerminalExpression**: Implements an interpret operation associated with terminal symbols in the grammar.

3. **NonterminalExpression**: One or more subclasses are used to define interpret operations for non-terminal symbols in the grammar.

4. **Context**: Contains information that is global to the interpreter.

5. **Client**: Builds (or is given) the abstract syntax tree and invokes the interpret operation.

## Example

Let's say we want to create a simple interpreter that evaluates expressions like "add 5 and 3" to produce the result "8". We would define terminal expressions like "add", "and", and non-terminal expressions like "Number". We then parse the input expression into an abstract syntax tree and evaluate it using the interpreter.

## Benefits

- Provides an easy way to represent grammars and interpret sentences in a language.
- Helps in adding new ways to interpret expressions without changing the grammar.
- Decouples the grammar from the interpreter, making it easier to maintain and extend.
