### Introduction
The Bridge Pattern is a structural design pattern used in object-oriented programming to decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two can vary independently. It involves creating two separate hierarchies—one for abstraction and one for implementation—and connecting them through composition.

### Purpose
The main purpose of the Bridge Pattern is to allow the abstraction and the implementation to vary independently of each other. This enables changes in the abstraction or the implementation to not affect each other, promoting flexibility and maintainability.

### How It Works
1. **Define Abstraction and Implementation**: Create two separate class hierarchies—one for abstraction (abstraction class and its subclasses) and one for implementation (implementor interface and its subclasses).
   
2. **Link Abstraction with Implementation**: In the abstraction class, include a reference to an implementor object. This allows the abstraction to delegate the implementation to the implementor.

3. **Implement Abstraction and Implementation**: Implement the methods in the abstraction and implementor hierarchies. The abstraction methods typically delegate the work to the corresponding implementor methods.

### Benefits
- **Decoupling**: Separates the abstraction from its implementation, allowing them to vary independently.
- **Flexibility**: Enables changes in abstraction or implementation without affecting each other.
- **Encapsulation**: Hides implementation details from clients, promoting information hiding.
